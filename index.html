    <h1>ValueCam Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 12, 2026</p>

    <p>ValueCam ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Photos:</strong> When you take or select a photo, it is sent to Google's Gemini AI service for analysis. Photos are processed in real time and are not stored on our servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> With your permission, we access your approximate location to provide region-specific pricing and currency. Location data is not stored or shared.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect anonymous usage statistics (number of scans, total value scanned) stored locally on your device only.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Gemini AI</strong> — processes photos for valuation. Subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> — displays advertisements. AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage data for ad personalization. Subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All app preferences and scan statistics are stored locally on your device using secure on-device storage. We do not operate any servers or databases that store your personal data.</p>

    <h2>4. Camera & Photo Library</h2>
    <p>The App requests access to your camera to photograph items and your photo library to select existing images. Photos taken with the camera are saved to your library for convenience. Photos selected from your library are not duplicated.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete it at any time by uninstalling the App. No account creation is required to use ValueCam.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
